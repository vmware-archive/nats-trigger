<h1 id="libraries_for_other_languages">Libraries For Other Languages</h1>

<p> If you don't want to invoke the jsonnet commandline utility to evaluate Jsonnet, there are also
libraries for Python and C.  In future we would like to support more languages by wrapping the C
API in each case.</p>

<h2 id="server_side">A Warning On Server-Side Evaluation</h2>

<p>If you are creating an API server that will evaluate untrusted Jsonnet code in the same process
that handles other requests, be aware of your exposure to denial of service attacks.  Since Jsonnet
allows expressing programs that take unreasonable amounts of CPU time and RAM, it is possible for a
malicious request to cause its host API server to exceed its OS resources and crash.  Such a crash
would affect concurrently running handlers for other users, and decrease your capacity until the
server is restarted.  A simple remedy for this situation is to <tt>exec</tt> the Jsonnet commandline
binary in a <tt>ulimit</tt> child process where the CPU and RAM can be tightly bounded for the
specific request.  Communication to and from the commandline binary could be via temporary files or
pipes.  Thus, only the malicious request fails.</p>

<p>Linking Jsonnet as a library is more appropriate for client-side applications or situations
where the configuration can be trusted.</p>


<h2 id="c_api">C API</h2>

<p>The C API simply wraps the C++ implementation to hide C++ language features like templates,
classes, overloading, etc.  This makes it easier to bind to other languages, as C is typically the
lowest common denominator across all systems.</p>

<p>The API is documented in <a
href="http://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/include/libjsonnet.h">libjsonnet.h</a>.  It is
built with 'make libjsonnet.so'.  It is used by the python bindings, the Jsonnet commandline tool,
as well as a couple of simpler tests.  Search for #include "libjsonnet.h".  </p>

<p>To use the API, create a JsonnetVM object, set various options, then tell it to evaluate a
filename or snippet.  To avoid leaking memory, the result of execution (JSON or error message) and
the JsonnetVM object itself must be cleaned up using the corresponding functions.</p>

<h2 id="python_api">Python API</h2>

<p>The Python API wraps the C API in a straightforward way.  It can be installed with <tt>pip
install jsonnet</tt> or built directly with <tt>setup.py</tt>.</p>

<p>The Python module provides two functions, <tt>evaluate_file(f)</tt> and <tt>evaluate_snippet(f,
e)</tt>.  In the latter case, the parameter <tt>f</tt> is used in stack traces due to errors raised
in the snippet.</p>

<p>Keyword arguments to these functions are used to control the virtual machine.  They include
<tt>gc_min_objects</tt>, <tt>gc_growth_trigger</tt>, <tt>ext_vars</tt>, <tt>debug_ast</tt>, and
<tt>max_trace</tt>.  The <tt>debug_ast</tt> argument is a boolean, and <tt>ext_vars</tt> is a dict
mapping strings to strings.  The other keyword arguments should be numbers.</p>

<p>Another keyword argument <tt>import_callback</tt> can be used to pass a callable to trap the
Jsonnet import constructs.  This allows, e.g., reading files out of archives or implementing library
search paths.  The supplied function must take two string arguments (directory of the current file
and the string given to the import construct, which can usually be concatenated to form an actual
path but that is up to you).  It returns a tuple of two strings, the first being the actual path of
the file and the second being the content.  The actual path is required so that imports can be
resolved within the imported file.</p>

<p>If an error is raised during the evaluation of the Jsonnet code, it is formed into a stack trace
and thrown as a python RuntimeError.  Otherwise, the JSON string is returned.  To convert this
into objects for easy interpretation in Python, use the <a
href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html">json</a> module.  An example:</p>

<pre>
import json
import _jsonnet

jsonnet_str = '''
{
    person1: {
        name: "Alice",
        welcome: "Hello " + self.name + "!",
    },
    person2: self.person1 { name: std.extVar("OTHER_NAME") },
}
'''

json_str = _jsonnet.evaluate_snippet("snippet", jsonnet_str, ext_vars={'OTHER_NAME': 'Bob'})
json_obj = json.loads(json_str)
for person_id, person in json_obj.iteritems():
    print('%s is %s, greeted by "%s"' % (person_id, person['name'], person['welcome']))
</pre>


<h2 id="third_party_apis">Unofficial Third Party APIs</h2>

<p>There are unofficial bindings available for other languages.  These are not supported by Google
and may be some versions behind the latest release.</p>
